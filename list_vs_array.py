# List vs Array

# c,c++,java--> array: stores only data of one type whether it is of int,string,float etc....

# List in Python: store any type of data ,since they are flexible.
# Python has an array module in which you can define data of only one type & its 
# performance is better but we don't use it most often.

#  Javascript array = python list
#  In data science for calculations we use "numpy" arrays which is a python module which has
#  its bbinding with the libraries of C Prog. Language.

# We can also create a bridge b/w Python & C Prog. language, so that we can achieve flexibility
#  of Python but Performance of C language since C is comparatively faster than Python.
